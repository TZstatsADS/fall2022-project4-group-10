+ Project summary: In this project, we self-learned and implement two algorithms: Fairness-aware Classifier with Prejudice Remover Regularizer (PR) and Information Theoretic Measures for Fairness-aware Feature selection (FFS). The first algorithm brings modifications to the logistic regression model and adds a constraint of a no indirect prejudice condition to diminish indirect prejudice. The second one develops a framework for fairness-aware feature selection.
